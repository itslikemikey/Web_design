        <div class="info-section"> 
            Abel is derived from fonts that are typically used in newspaper headlines, and poster. The style of the font is quite unique with the sharp angles used and a mono-weight used throughout the typeface. Although Abel has very sharp angles, there is as nice contrast with the curves used throughout the typeface as well. This allows it to stand out in displays and be read with ease.
